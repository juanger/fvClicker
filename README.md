Farmville Clicker
=============

Tired of clicking and moving your mouse to plant and harvest? I am, and so I created this simple auto clicker for farmville.

It is written in MacRuby and simulates clicks using CoreGraphics, in consequence it doesn't use any cheat engine and it is open source.

To use it you must login to your facebook account from the application and enter to the farmville application. Simulated clicks are spaced to work in the fully zoomed out view.

Features
-------

* Activate/Deactivate (Cmnd-E)
* Custom Width and Height of auto click area
